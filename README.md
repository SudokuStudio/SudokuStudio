## About

This is a basic web UI for a sudoku solving/setting tool.

## Development

Ensure you have NodeJS and `npm@^7.0.0`.

If your `npm --version` is below 7.0.0 you can update it. You may need to use `sudo`:
```
npm i -g npm@^7.0.0
```

Clone the project, `cd` inside, then to install the dependencies run:
```
npm ci
```

For a live-reloading development server run:
```
npm run dev
```

If you are using VSCode (recommended):
* Install "Svelte for VS Code" extension.
* Click the gear and go to "Extension Settings" and turn on `svelte.enable-ts-plugin`.
* Restart VSCode.
