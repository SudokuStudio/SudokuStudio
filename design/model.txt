A model of what a sudoku is, with variant constraints as minimal constraint properties which can combine to make several popular variants.

- sudoku
	- properties
		- size
			- a square with a whole number side length, likely minimum 3 and maximum 25
	- objects
		- lines
			- a line is a series of points
			- can host several types of constraints, including thermos, no-repeats, sums
		- areas
			- an area is a set of cells
			- can host several types of constraints, including no-repeats, sums
		- symbols
			- symbols sit within a cell, on a cell edge, or on a cell corner
			- can host several types of constraints
		- digits
			- contained in a cell
			- is constrained, has no constraints of its own
	- constraints
		- cells can only contain digits from this set
		- cells must sum to this number
		- cells can't repeat digits
		- cells must be monotonic
			- cells must be increasing
			- cells must be decreasing
		- cells must form a palindrome
		- cells must form a german whisper
		- cells between the x and y must [insert another constraint]
		- the maximum value is overtaken x times over this series (skyscraper)
		- the minimum value is undertaken x times over this series
		- cells must have a specified mathematical relationship
		- here's all the possibilities for this set of cells
		- two or more areas' digits must match or be subsets
